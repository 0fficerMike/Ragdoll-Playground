# Ragdoll-Playground
In Ragdoll Playground you can experiment with ragdolls in virtual reality.
Throw ragdolls of buildings, let a ragdoll fall off the stairs and more!

Keep in mind that all the current releases are all in alpha state and that nothing is final yet.
If you found a bug or want to suggest something please do that here
and create a new issue, I will add the corresponding tag to it.
Current versions are also currently having bad lightning (This will get fixed in future versions because I will have to learn how to light a scene better in my journey of programming).

P.S. I'm still a student that's going to school, so this is a project I only work on in my free time. Sometimes it can take up to 2 weeks or even a month until I release a new update. It just depends on how much work I have for school. I'm also still learning how to program so I'm not an experienced programmer yet.
