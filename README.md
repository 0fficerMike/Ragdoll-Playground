# Ragdoll-Playground
In Ragdoll Playground you can experiment with ragdolls in virtual reality.
Throw ragdolls of buildings, let a ragdoll fall off the stairs and more!

Keep in mind that all the current releases are all in alpha state and that nothing is final yet.
If you found a bug or want to suggest something please go to the github (Link on this page)
and create a new issue, I will add the corresponding tag to it.
Current versions are also currently having bad lightning (This will get fixed in future versions).

Controls:
 - Teleporting ---> Right Trigger
 - Moving ---> Left Joystick
 - Snap Turning ---> Right Joystick
- Grabbing ---> Grip Button
- UI Interaction ---> Trigger Button
